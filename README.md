# Dataporten and Node.js using OpenID Connect


A simple example of using an OpenID Connect library to conect with Dataporten using Node.js

This is only for debugging, experimenting and understanding how OpenID Connect works and can be used. Not ready for integration with applications.

To run:

```
npm install
npm start
```


To use OpenID Connect with  Dataporten from an Node.js application in production, instead use in example the passportjs opendid connect strategy. Link to be added.
